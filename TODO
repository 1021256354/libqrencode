Thread unsafe.
Only two functions, QRspec_newFrame() and init_rs(), are thread unsafe, but
all of qrencode functions are thread unsafe because of them.
Version 3.0 of libqrencode will introduce semaphores to avoid this problem.
It also requires, however, a kind of init function of libqrencode such as
QRencode_init().

This package contains

*.c and *.h files (total):  7967 lines, 196078 bytes.
configure script         : 22511 lines, 724922 bytes.

It's absolutely crazy.

This library does not return any error code (just returns NULL silently).
