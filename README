libqrencode 1.0.0 - QR Code encoding library

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Libqrencode is a library for encoding data in a QR Code symbol, a kind of 2D
symbology that can be scanned by handy terminals such as a mobile phone with
CCD. The capacity of QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000 characters, and has
high robustness.


SPECIFICATION
=============
Libqrencode supports QR Code model 2, described in JIS (Japanese Industrial
Standards) X0510:2004 or ISO/IEC 18004. Currently the following features are
not supported:
- ECI and FNC1 mode
- Structured Append Feature
- Micro QR Code
- QR Code model 1


INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
Some test programs or utility tools requires SDL, but the library itself has no
dependencies. You can skip compiling those tools when if you want not to
install programs using SDL. If you are trying to compile this library on MS-
Windows, cygwin or some kinds of UNIX-like environments will be needed.

Compile & install
-----------------
Just try

./configure
make
make install

This compiles and installs the library and header file to the appropriate
directories. By default, /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include. You can change
the destination directory by passing some options to the configure script.
Run "./configure --help" to see the list of options.

Currently no program will be installed. If you want to install a binary
(e.g. view_qrcode), please copy it manually.
