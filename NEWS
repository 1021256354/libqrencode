libqrencode NEWS - Overview of changes
======================================

Version 2.0.0 (2007.12.xx)
--------------------------
Summary:
* "-i" option to ignore case distinctions has been added to qrencode and
  view_qrcode.
* "-c" option (case-sensitive mode) of qrencode is now enabled by default and
  has been improved. See details in Release Note section.
* "-8" option has been added to qrencode to encode whole data in 8-bit mode.
* tests/view_qrcode now accepts various options like qrencode.

* API changes
  - QRcode_encodeString() now receives case-sensitive flag.
  - QRcode_encodeStringCase() has been removed.
  - QRcode_encodeString8bit() has been added.

Release Note:

Previously libqrencode encodes lower-case alphabet characters in Alphabet-
Numeric mode (upper-case alphabet and numeric) by default. According to the
specification of QR code, however, it is clearly claimed that Alphabet-Numeric
mode provides only upper-case alphabet (+ numeric and some symbol) characters.
Since this version, libqrencode distinguishes lower-case and upper-case of
alphabet characters by default. Because of that, "-c" option of qrencode
is now deprecated, and "-i" option has been added. By giving "-i", qrencode
converts lower-case characters to upper-case if possible, then encode a QR code
symbol. Please read qrencode.h for the details about API changes if you are
going to use this library.
